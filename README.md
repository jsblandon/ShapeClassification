# ShapeClassification
The .zip file contains the required codes to run Bag of Contour Fragments method over binary image databases. We used the code version proposed in the paper:  

Wang X, Feng B, Bai X, Liu W, Latecki LJ. Bag of contour fragments for robust shape classification. Pattern Recognition. 2014 Jun 1;47(6):2116-25.

The Centered Kernel Alignment implementation used is a Python version from the paper:

Alvarez-Meza AM, Orozco-Gutierrez A, Castellanos-Dominguez G. Kernel-based relevance analysis with enhanced interpretability for detection of brain activity patterns. Frontiers in neuroscience. 2017 Oct 6;11:550.
